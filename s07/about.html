            Ada Lovelace the 'First Computer Programmer'
            </h1>
            <p class="lady">
                Lady Augusta Ada Lovelace is known for her work on computers with Charles Babbage - she was the first person to recognise the technique of computing and writing programmes - she was effectively the first computer programmer.

   <h1 class="whoisshe">Who is she?</h1>

   <div class="paragraph">

    <p>
        Ada Lovelace was the daughter of the noted poet Lord Byron and Annabella Milbanke Byron. Their marriage lasted little more than a year, and Ada never met her father. To counteract the "dangerous" mental tendencies of Ada's father, Annabella emphasized music, French, and mathematics in her daughter's studies. This last subject particularly appealed to Ada.
    </p> <br>

    <p>
        In 1833 Ada Lovelace met the mathematician Charles Babbage, who had designed a calculating machine called the Difference Engine. Lovelace was inspired by the prototype of the Difference Engine and became Babbage's lifelong friend. Babbage had a new project in mind, a much more-advanced machine, the Analytical Engine. In 1843 Lovelace translated a French paper that Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea wrote about the Analytical Engine. She also added thousands of words of her own notes to the paper. Lovelace realized that the Analytical Engine could carry out an extensive sequence of mathematical operations. The example she wrote of one such sequence‚Äîhow to calculate Bernoulli numbers‚Äîis regarded by computer historians as the first computer program. She even speculated that the Analytical Engine could be used to perform operations on "other things besides number," such as musical notes.
    </p> <br>

    <p>
        Only a small piece of the Analytical Engine was ever built, and Ada Lovelace died in 1852. Her fame lives on, however. She gave her name to the Ada programming language. Every year on the second Tuesday in October, the contributions of women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are celebrated on Ada Lovelace Day.
    </p>

    <h1 class="first">Lovelace's first computer programme</h1>
    <p>
        Ada Lovelace's friendship flourished with Babbage. She became engaged with his plans for his analytical engine. She studied the plans and became very familiar with it and the way it worked. Lovelace was very fortunate that her husband supported her work with Babbage, despite what many men of the time might have done and possibly what others thought. In 1842, Babbage went to Turin to present a lecture to the University there. As a result, one of the attendees published his notes (in French) in the Bibliotheque Universelle de Geneve. A friend of Babbage, Charles Wheatstone asked Lovelace, who was fluent in French to translate the paper, and even corrected some of the errors there as her knowledge was very deep. She even added many footnotes extending the length oft he paper a few times.
    </p> <br>

    <p>
        In one of these footnotes, Ada Lovelace details a number of programmes showing how they worked. One example was for the calculation of Bernoulli numbers, and it showed how the Analytical Engine could be used to calculate mathematical series or other useful items. She also provided details of how algebraic formulae could be reduced to a series of basic instructions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and how these could be coded onto the Engine.
        The computer programme in these notes are widely accepted to be the first example of a computer programme detailed anywhere.
